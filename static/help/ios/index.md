# PreMatch for iOS

We all know that the 7+H schedule is very complex---with a rotation of 8 distinct days and 8 letter-encoded "blocks",
the 7+H schedule really obfuscates our efforts to reason about it.
Way too many times have you asked "what day is it?", "what block do I have next?", and "what blocks do I have tomorrow?".
PreMatch for iOS is about to change it all.
