# Privacy with PreMatch
_As fellow students at Andover High School, we the creators of PreMatch recognize your concerns about maintaining your privacy, and our goal with this brief privacy policy is to set boundaries and expectations for data collection and handling._

## Introduction
We consider your schedules to be sensitive information. Although only the teacher is recorded for matching purposes, they specify certain attributes of your class with them, such as subjects and levels. For example, a class with DiBenedetto is guaranteed to be either Java or AP Java. Because of this potential of exploitation, we give you full control of the visibility of your schedule and the right to remove it from our system.

## Data Collection and Usage
We collect the following information from you.

#### Information that you give us
- The names of your teachers for blocks A through G, for class matching purposes. These may be shared with the PreMatch mobile app at your discretion.
- Your lunch numbers for blocks C through G, when optionally given, for lunch matching purposes.
- Your name and k12.andoverma.us email address, for unique account identification and verification.
- Whether you accept to make your schedule public, for your control over schedule visibility.

#### Information collected automatically
- Details of your requests to PreMatch.org, including IP address, browser type and version, operating system and computer platform. These help us improve the website's experience by learning about how our website is being accessed.
- A custom browser "cookie" for session continuity. The "cookie" is an encrypted form of your email address and can only be issued and read by our system. It keeps you signed in during a browsing session.

## Children Under the Age of 13

PreMatch.org restricts its user base to students at Andover High School, and we do not expect any such student to be under the age of 13. Extreme prodigies that violate this expectation are not allowed to use this service.

## Communications

PreMatch is evolving constantly as a product, and new features may become available to you in the future. In such case, we will use your k12.andoverma.us email address to notify you about them. These emails will include an "unsubscribe" link, using which you may request to opt out of such notifications.

If you have any uncertainties about this policy or any complaints about our compliance with this policy, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@prematch.org).

## Data Retention

You have the right to request the removal of your schedule from our system, including all teachers for blocks A through G. To do so, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@prematch.org?subject=Request to Remove Data).

## Future Updates

The evolution of PreMatch and your suggestions may necessitate future edits to this privacy policy. In such case, we will post a prominent notice on the front page of PreMatch.org at least 7 days before the relevant changes become effective.
