# Privacy with PreMatch
_As fellow students at Andover High School, we, the creators of PreMatch, recognize your privacy concerns, and our goal with this brief privacy policy is to set boundaries and expectations for  the collection and handling of your data._

## Introduction
The PreMatch team, hereafter referred to as "we", recognize that your schedule are sensitive information. When you enter your schedule into PreMatch, only the names of your teachers is recorded, for the purpose of matching you with your classmates _only_. Although we never ask for other information, such as the names and levels of your courses, such information may be found by other members of the platform via the process of elimination. Because of this potential of exploitation, we give you full control of the visibility of your schedule and the right to remove it from our system. 

## Data Collection and Usage
When you join PreMatch and enter your schedule, we collect and store the following data:

- The names of your teachers for blocks A through G, used _only_ for class matching purposes. This data will be shared to our other products, such as _PreMatch for iOS_, but only when you explicitly choose to do so.
- Your lunches for blocks C through G, when optionally given by you or one of your classmates, is saved for lunch matching purposes.
- Your full name and k12.andoverma.us email address, for unique account identification and verification.
- Your unique Discord ID, should you choose to connect your Discord account to your PreMatch account
- Whether or not you accept to make your schedule public, for your control over schedule visibility.
- Whether or not you accept this privacy policy and the terms and conditions of service
- Details of your requests to PreMatch.org, including IP address, browser type and version, operating system and computer platform. These help us improve the website's experience by learning about how our website is being accessed.
